# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 2, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I set up the git repository and boilerplate code for my React project, ChaiCMS. I upgraded the packages in package.json that were outdated from the Udemy React course. This caused issues with webpack that I went through and fixed.

**Thoughts:** I thought diving by myself into webpack once everything broke after the upgrades was going to be really scary since I am new to webpack config, but it wasn't too bad. Some googling and documentation reading got me going in the right direction. It was great seeing the dev server fire up successfully after getting everything set up.
