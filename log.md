# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 2, Friday

**Today's Progress**: I set up the git repository and boilerplate code for my React project, ChaiCMS. I upgraded the packages in package.json that were outdated from the Udemy React course. This caused issues with webpack that I went through and fixed.

**Thoughts:** I thought diving by myself into webpack once everything broke after the upgrades was going to be really scary since I am new to webpack config, but it wasn't too bad. Some googling and documentation reading got me going in the right direction. It was great seeing the dev server fire up successfully after getting everything set up.

### Day 2: November 3, Saturday

**Today's Progress**: I created the Sidebar component for ChaiCMS, hard-coding the links for the moment to point to the dashboard page. I added initial styles for the layout. I then created the Settings page and settings form, adding functionality to edit and display the site title and site description, integrating with the Firebaase database.

**Thoughts:** I feel like I made fast progress building out the components I worked on today, helped by the boilerplate project from the React Udemy course I just completed. So far, I am feeling pretty comfortable modifying the boilerplate code to build what I need. Tomorrow I plan on creating the tests for the Sidebar and Settings components, actions, and reducers.
